<h1>First Code challenge 2021</h1>
<p>The challenge was to read a simple image file and do some analysis on the byte values</p>
<p>To get a simple image I used <a href="https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/" >ESA Sentinel browser</a> and got an image from the Sentinel5 satellite. The image is a CH4 image which shows methaan concentration over a large area</p>
<p>The output is a histogram of pixel values, that are normalized</p>
